### Problems that will be solved by this app

1. we wanted to connect two people who want to communicate with each other. so I came up with an idea to make an app which would help to communicate with each other.

### Wire frame

Here we are using switch navigator to navigate between screens.

The switch navigator will have these  following screens â†’

1.Loadscreen : This screen will check if the user is authenticated or not. If the user is authenticated then, He would be navigated to HomeScreen and if he does not exist then he would be navigated  to Authencation screen

2.AuthScreen: Here the user has to sign in and he would be asked for his name and phone number. then he has to click the click send opt button to get the otp.

3.VerifyOtpScreen : Here the user should verify the recaptcha then a 6 digit code will be sent on to his registered phone number.He would have to enter his otp and if the otp is correct then a new will be created and he would be redirected to homeScreen.

4.HomeScreen: Here the user could chat with the people to whom he wants to talk. For doing that he should only click on the chat field to whom he wants to talk.

5.ChatScreen : Here the user can chat with another person, for doing so he just have to enter the desired text in the text input then he has to just click on the enter button to send the message.

6.Search Screen : Here the user can add some other users Simply just by searching the the desired username of the another person. If the searched username exists in the database then there will be some field at the search screen and If the user wants to chat with searched user then he just have to click on that result field and then he would be directed to chat screen.
